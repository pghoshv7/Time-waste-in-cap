		<h3>Re-host</h3>
		<p>
			Rehosting: also known as lift-and-shift.<br /> Deploying the
			application in cloud platform without applying any change in the
			existing application.<br /> Its very fast and can be done both
			manually or using automated tools.<br />
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Re-platform" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Re-platform</h3>
		<p>
			Replatforming: This approach will require few configuration changes
			or a few other cloud optimizations in order to achieve some tangible
			benefits,<br /> but otherwise not changing the core architecture of
			the application. Applications which are already hosted in cloud can
			later be re-desingned easily.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Re-write" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Re-write</h3>
		<p>
			Rewrite: This approach requires the existing application to be
			completely redesigned/re-architectured by applying micro-service based
			architecture <br /> following best practices of cloud based
			development. This approach is typically driven by a strong business
			need to add features, scale, or performance <br /> that would be
			difficult to achieve in the applicationâ€™s existing environment.<br />
			This pattern tends to be the most expensive, but it can also be the
			most beneficial.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="Co-exist" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>Co-exist</h3>
		<p>
			Co-exist: This approach requires moving few of the existing
			applications to cloud while keeping others in the local data center.
			<br /> This approach best suited for Companies don't want to deploy
			all of their applications to cloud because of various
			reasons(Security, contracts etc..) or those who just started
			their cloud migration journey.
